Color Picker: Classic
----------------------
The latest rendition of the Color Picker “Classic”, themed after Photoshop, GIMP, and other image editors—there are no frills here, it’s a basic Hue, Saturation, Value, and Alpha (HSVA) color selector. 

Color Picker: HSL + RGBA
-------------------------
This color picker allows you to create colors with fine detail. 
You can actually see the changes in <canvas> as you adjust the Hue, Saturation, Value along with the Red, Green, and Blue values. 

Color Picker: Sphere
---------------------
The main benefit of the Color Sphere over the traditional Color Picker is it’s size, it barely takes up any pixel space at all.  Need more precision? You can resize it!
